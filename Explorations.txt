Questions to answer
What would happen if we did absolutely nothing, starting right now?
	EncounterRate = 0.25;
	DaysSick = 14;
	DeathRate = 0.02f;
	VentilatorCount = 170000;
	HospitalizationRate = ;

	SusceptiblePop = 999999;
	InfectedPop = 1;
	RecoveredPop = 0;
	OriginalPop = SusceptiblePop + InfectedPop + RecoveredPop;

	SimulationDays = 365;
	DaysImmune = SimulationDays + 1;
	MaxThreads = 4;

What happens if we go for a "herd immunity strategy" but let the most vulnerable stay in?
	This is basically the same as cutting out the vulnerable portion of the
	population from susceptible. This is primarily a drop in fatality rate

What happens if we stop early?
When can we stop such that we no longer enter back into exponential growth?
In other words, how many of us have to be immune for the number of infections to only drop?
What happens if people can lose their immunity?
