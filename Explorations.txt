Questions to answer
What would happen if we did absolutely nothing, starting right now?
	Notes on Model
		US EncounterRate = 0.25, which is about where it was at the beginning of the pandemic
		http://www.davidketcheson.info/2020/03/19/SIR_Estimating_parameters.html

		EncounterRate lowered for less dense Oregon. US density is about
		87 people / sq. mi. Oregon density is about 39 people / sq. mi. 
		(Sourced on Wikipedia). Let's assume encounter rate is approximately
		linearly related to density, and say Oregon's EncounterRate = 0.11 

		The recovered pop might be underestimated, but the infected pop might be
		as well. This is because it's determined from reported cases.

	Speculative Narrative Summary
		We weren't ready for things to go back to normal. We were just at the 
		start of the curve. Herd immunity didn't come for over a month. The 
		hardest month we ever knew. 
		Even after herd immunity, there tens of thousands of new cases in the 
		country every day. Thousands died every day. 
		Oregon, California, it didn't matter. Things got so much worse than New
		York was in March and April. You were probably infected. 
		You almost certainly know multiple people who had the infection. 
		There's a good chance someone you know died. 
		Many never got a ventilator who needed them. Doctors are forced to choose 
		who lives and who dies.
		The country spent months with every ventilator occupied. 

What happens if we keep the curve under ventilator capacity?

	Notes on the model
		This is done by lowering the encounter rate to a point that the peak
		never exceeds the global ventilator count by a large factor. 
		This value is somewhere around (1 / DaysRecovery).

What if governors and people stop taking it seriously? (Life returns to normal in 30 days)
	Notes on the model
		Start with very aggressive quarantining. EncounterRate = 0.03. 
		After new cases is under 500, EncounterRate returns to value from first model.
		The results basically show why things won't be back to normal without
		additional aggressive testing and monitoring. If we go about our daily
		lives, we need another way to lower the encounter rate

What happens if we go for a "herd immunity strategy" but let the most vulnerable stay in?
	Notes on the model:
		This is basically the same as cutting out the vulnerable portion of the
		population from susceptible. This is primarily a drop in fatality rate 
		and a reduction in the susceptible population
