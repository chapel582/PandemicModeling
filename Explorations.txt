NOTE: 
I eventually did my own fit on the US's deaths between it's first death and March
21. It came to an encounter rate of about 0.2192, so my model's are probably a 
little pessimistic when it comes to the # infected and the number of deaths.
I eventually did a fit on Oregon's COVID19 deaths between it's first death
and two weeks after its stay at home order started (March 23). It came to an 
encounter rate of about 0.147, which was pretty close to my density based 
estimate. Though of course, it would actually be worse than this. I used excel 
for the exponential fit.  

Questions to answer
What would happen if we went back to normal, starting right now?
	Notes on Model
		US EncounterRate = 0.25, which is about where it was at the beginning of the pandemic
		http://www.davidketcheson.info/2020/03/19/SIR_Estimating_parameters.html

		EncounterRate lowered for less dense Oregon. US density is about
		87 people / sq. mi. Oregon density is about 39 people / sq. mi. 
		(Sourced on Wikipedia). Let's assume encounter rate is approximately
		linearly related to density, and say Oregon's EncounterRate = 0.11 

		The recovered pop might be underestimated, but the infected pop might be
		as well. This is because it's determined from reported cases.

What if governors and people stop taking it seriously? (Life returns to normal)
	Notes on the model
		Start with very aggressive quarantining. EncounterRate = 0.03. 
		After new cases is under 500, EncounterRate returns to value from first model.
		The results basically show why things won't be back to normal without
		additional aggressive testing and monitoring. If we go about our daily
		lives, we need another way to lower the encounter rate

What's the earliest we can reintroduce the vulnerable population without 
restarting the pandemic assuming we maintain good encounter rate after reintroduction?
	Notes on model
		We reintroduce as soon as the current susceptible plus the vulnerable divided by the total population (including the vulnerable) is
		less than or equal to gamma over beta 

		vulnerable pop is 40325924
		gamma over beta is 0.71428571429

		This strategy isn't easily accomplished without waiting years for the 
		pandemic to die down, and then there should be a readily available 
		vaccine. The susceptible population of the strong doesn't get low enough
		without increasing the encounter rate and letting many more of them die.

What would happen if we went back to normal and people can lose immunity?		
	Notes on model
		https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-will-coronavirus-end/608719/
		" When people are infected by the milder human coronaviruses that cause cold-like symptoms, they remain immune for less than a year. By contrast, the few who were infected by the original SARS virus, which was far more severe, stayed immune for much longer. Assuming that SARS-CoV-2 lies somewhere in the middle, people who recover from their encounters might be protected for a couple of years."

		Since the infected count hits 0 in this model before immunity is done,
		this isn't different than scenario 1.
